    ## Welcome to the Epileptic Seizure Prediction System
    
    This application uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze Electroencephalogram (EEG) 
    data and predict the likelihood of an epileptic seizure. Early prediction can help patients and 
    caregivers take preventive measures, potentially reducing the impact of seizures and improving 
    quality of life.
    
    ### Key Features:
    
    - **Real-time EEG Data Analysis**: Input EEG channel readings for immediate seizure prediction
    - **Precautionary Guidance**: Receive guidance on steps to take when a seizure is predicted
    - **Educational Resources**: Learn about epilepsy, its causes, symptoms, and management
    
    ### How to Use This Application:
    
    1. Navigate to the **Prediction** page to input EEG readings and get predictions
    2. Visit the **About Epilepsy** page to learn more about the condition
    3. Check the **Precautions** page for guidance on managing seizure risks
